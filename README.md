# Generative Art

This is the conecept of art created via computer algorithm implementing structured randomness and a collection of those intersting algorithms.

Below is the first example of art I created via algorithm. It came from https://github.com/paraschopra/abstract-art-neural-network initially. I intend to adjust this and create more interesting things from it. This is a neat little series (hopefully) of interesting algorithms creating generative art. It will most likely be a long process of gaining an understanding of generative art, but at the very least it will be an intersting one.
